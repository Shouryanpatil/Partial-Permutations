# Partial Permutations

## Problem Description
A **partial permutation** is an arrangement of **k** distinct elements chosen from a set of **n** unique elements. The number of such arrangements is given by:

\[ P(n, k) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!} \]

This formula counts how many ways you can arrange **k** elements from a total of **n**, where order matters.

### Input
Two positive integers:
- `n`: Total number of items (1 ≤ n ≤ 100)
- `k`: Number of items to arrange (1 ≤ k ≤ 10)

### Output
Return the number of partial permutations \( P(n, k) \) **modulo 1,000,000**.

## Example
**Input:**
```
21 7
```

**Output:**
```
51200
```
